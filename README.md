# Logistic-Regression-from-scratch
A complete implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch with Python &amp; Numpy + Testing of the implementation on a test dataset made from `make_dataset` function of sklearn.datasets with 96.6% accuracy! 

Also shown is the cost/loss function decreasing with the number of iterations through gradient descent.
